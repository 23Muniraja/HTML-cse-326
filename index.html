<h2 style=" text-align:center;color:red"><u><i> Definition of politics ?</i></u></h2>

<p1 style="color:green"><center>Politics (from Greek: Πολιτικά, politiká, 
'affairs of the cities') is the set of activities <br>that are associated 
with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations <br>among
 individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status. The branch of
 <br>social science that studies politics and government is referred to as 
<a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Political+views" target="_blank">
political science</a></center></p1>
<br><br>
<p2 style="color:green"><center>
1)a: the art or science of government<br>
b: the art or science concerned with guiding or influencing governmental policy<br>
c: the art or science concerned with winning and holding control over a government<br>
2): political actions, practices, or policies<br>
3)a: political affairs or business especially : competition between competing interest groups 
<br>
or individuals for power and leadership (as in a government)<br>
b: political life especially as a principal activity or profession<br>
c: political activities characterized by artful and often dishonest practices<br>
4): the political opinions or sympathies of a person<br>
5)a: the total complex of relations between people living in society<br>
b: relations or conduct in a particular area of experience especially as seen or dealt 
with from a political point of view</center></h2>

<h3 style=" text-align:center;color:red"><u><i> Playing Politics</i></u></h2>

<p3 style="color:green"><center>Politics is a multifaceted word. It has a set of fairly<br>
specific meanings that are descriptive and nonjudgmental (such as “the art or science <br>
of government” and "political principles"), but it can and often does carry a negative <br>
meaning closely related to these (“political activities characterized by artful and <br>
often dishonest practices”). English is a flexible language, and it is not uncommon for<br>
a word to have multiple related meanings that run the connotative gamut from good to bad.<br>
Some of these have been around for a surprisingly long time. The negative sense of politics,<br>
as seen in the phrase play politics, for example, has been in use since at least 1853,<br>
when abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared: “We do not play politics; anti-slavery is no<br>
half-jest with us.”</center></p3>
